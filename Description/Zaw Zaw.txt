Early life
Zaw Zaw attended University of Rangoon and graduated with a Major in Mathematics.[8] He had worked in Japan for several years before returning to Myanmar in 1993 and set up Max Myanmar company.

Business holdings
He reportedly had close ties to key figures from the former ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, including Maung Aye and Than Shwe's grandson Nay Shwe Thway Aung. Through his relationships, he is believed to have won concessions and import licenses, including most of the country's car and motorcycle import licenses, as well as import and distribution licenses for fuel.
His company won several bids to construct Naypyidaw, the country's new capital, including a stadium for the 2013 Southeast Asian Games.[9] But his attempt to enter the Singaporean stock market as an international businessman by bidding over Aussino Group Ltd. was not successful. He was blacklisted by the United States, being one of around 200 individuals and companies that had sanctions against doing business with them imposed, under a Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List regulated by the U.S. Treasury. Singaporean stock market regulators were concerned at this and rejected the bid in January 2013.[10]Annual revenue of Max Myanmar Group was about US $500 million in early 2010s.[10]
He was delisted from SDN list by the US Treasury in 2016.[11]

Recognition

On 30 April, 2013, he was presented the State Excellence Award of the President of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for being one of the top taxpayers in the country. [13]

In 2013 November, he led the MFF to obtain the AFC Dream Asia award, which is given in recognition of those who share the values of Dream Asia, the AFC’s social responsibility initiative, which promotes the culture of giving, and emphasizes the power of football in bringing about positive change in respective Asian societies.[14]

He empowered Myanmar National Under-20 Football Team to reach FIFA U-20 World cup 2015 in New Zealand [15] and the MFF was recognized by the AFF Association of the Year award at the AFF Awards 2015 [16] in mid August, for the second time running.
